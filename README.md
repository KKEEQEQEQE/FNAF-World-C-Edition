# What is FNaF World: C Edition

DISCLAIMER: This is a free and open-source, fan-made passion project made by a FNaF Fan for the FNaF Fans. It is a recreation of FNaF World. I don't own the sprites, music, or original game, what I own is the code (which I put under the Zlib License), feel free-to-use it, you don't need any permission from me!

Also, the source code will be made public when Demo 1 is released because it is a little messy right now and needs some polishing, as well as some comments.

About the Game:
FNaF World: C Edition is a completely open-source recreation of FNaF World in C and Raylib for the purpose of being multi-platform (so that the game can run on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS (this Safari similarly to Sonic 3 A.I.R), Linux, your web browser, etc instead of just Windows) and having a couple of quality-of-life features such as proper widescreen support (in fact you can run the native perfectly at any aspect ratio), windowed mode, etc. It will be easy to modify the game (if you want to make mods but that isn't the main game of this remake). This is a recreation from entirely scratch (except for the original sprites and music). This version of the game doesn't contain ANY source code from the original game and is made in pure C with Raylib instead of Clickteam Fusion, so there will be major performance increases and use significantly less RAM (never more than 100 MB worst case scenario). Although the recreation aims for it to be 1 to 1 (in terms of gameplay and graphics) there is bound to be at least 1 or 2 minor differences, nobody is perfect ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Right now the src only supports Windows but it shouldn't be hard to port it
